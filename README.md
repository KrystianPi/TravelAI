# TravelAI
Welcome to TravelAI repository! This Python application leverages the power of several cutting-edge technologies, including Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (LLM with RAG), Wikipedia articles, image captioning models, and geospatial data, to provide users with a unique experience of exploring and learning about the landmarks of Rome.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizing a Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (LLM with RAG), our application can understand and respond to user queries in natural language. Whether you want to chat or speak (audio to text to audio), the application is designed to facilitate a smooth interaction.

- **Wikipedia Integration**: The application taps into Wikipedia's vast repository of articles related to Rome's landmarks. It retrieves relevant information to answer your questions, provide historical context, and offer insightful details about each landmark.

- **Image Captioning**: For a more immersive experience, the application employs image captioning models to describe the visual aspects of Rome's landmarks. This feature enriches your understanding of the landmarks and their surroundings.

- **Geospatial Data**: By incorporating GPS location data, the application efficiently indexes the Wikipedia database. This means you can easily access information about landmarks based on your current location or specific geographical interests.

- **Object Recognition**: The vision model integrated into the application allows you to inquire about objects inside the landmarks. Simply provide a description or an image, and the application will attempt to identify and provide information about the objects you're curious about.
