      "Since its foundation, the city of Rome has been encircled with walls. The Servian Wall of the early 4th century BC expanded upon the original pomerium of the Romulan city that defined the ancient Roma quadrata (ca. 8th century BC). Sixteen gates were built along the Servian Wall, although more were added later or are considered part of the circuit. Most of those gates are gone, as the remains of the Servian Wall are scant. The Aurelian Wall of the 270s AD included many gates, most of which are still standing today, some in very good condition. Later, fortifications were added on, notably by Pope Leo I, who encircled the so-called Leonine City with a defenses in the mid-9th century AD. Walls were also added on the Janiculum Hill in the 17th century by Pope Urban VIII; all of these walls required gates, which are listed below.\n",

In addition, chain-towers were also built on either side of the Tiber river to repel Saracen assaults by water.

      "\n",
      "Biography\n",
      "Anicia Demetrias, born around 398, was the daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius, consul in 395, and of Anicia Iuliana, and thus member of the noble gentes Anicia and Amnia; her grandmother Proba is described as the noblest and richest person in the Roman world in the 410s.In 410, in occasion of the sack of Rome, Demetrias left Rome with her mother Iuliana and with her paternal grandmother Anicia Faltonia Proba and went to Carthage; here they were imprisoned by the comes Heraclianus, and freed only after a huge payment.While her mother and her grandmother lived in Carthage, they came into contact with Augustine of Hippo, who helped them to follow the path of a religious life. Demetrias, who was about fifteen years old in 413, was to be married, but she secretly followed an ascetical way of life, influenced by Augustine. She did not tell her relatives about her choice, as she was worried about displeasing them. However, as her marriage was approaching, she decided to tell her mother Iuliana and her grandmother Proba about her intention to renounce to marry and to take the veil. Her relatives were very happy with her, and, in 413, Demetrias took the veil in a ceremony celebrated by Bishop Aurelius of Carthage.\n",
      "To help her in her spiritual life, Iuliana and Proba asked several churchmen to send Demetrias advice. Augustine answered, suggesting the reading of his De sancta virginitate, Jerome sent a long letter with several pieces of advice, while Pelagius, a theologian opposed by Augustine, addressed her a treatise in the form of a letter, the Epistola ad Demetriam.\n",
      "Later in her life, Demetrias returned to her native city of Rome. During this time she received the Epistula ad Demetriadem de vera humilitate, written in 440 by Pope Leo I or, according to recent studies, in 435 by Prosper of Aquitaine, and attacking Pelagius' doctrine on the basis of Augustine.Demetrias built a church devoted to Saint Stephen along the Via Latina (41°51′41.81″N 12°32′15.17″E ), three miles from Rome, on one of her properties. She died during the pontificate of Pope Leo I.\n",

      "The Seven Halls, or Sette Sale, is the name of the complex of cisterns located on the Oppian Hill, Rome. The name comes from the fact that, when the complex was noted in the mid-eighteenth century, only seven chambers were recognised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description\n",
      "This large cistern holding over 8 million litres supplied the Baths of Trajan and was fed by a branch aqueduct that came from the Esquiline Hill.\n",
      "Since it is oriented on the same axis as the nearby and differently than the Baths, it was once thought to have belonged to the Domus Aurea. However, the many brick stamps found in its wall prove that it was built at the same time as the Baths. It is on two levels, each consisting of nine (not seven) parallel compartments more than 5 m wide and 30 to 40 m long (differing because of the curve of the eastern perimeter wall). The lower level is a cryptoporticus supporting the true reservoir on the upper level which was high enough for water to flow out with enough pressure to supply the Baths. The compartments' walls and floors were lined with waterproof plaster.\n",
      "The cistern was partially underground, with the back curved wall and the two side walls partially covered and buttressed by the embankment, while the impressive straight front wall with alternating rectangular and semicircular niches was visible. Large openings in the niches of the upper level provided ventilation. Water flowed out of pipes in the low-level niches into a large pipe a part of which has been found in front of the northeastern exedra of the Baths.\n",
      "Also on the ground level of the complex were found the remains of a grotto lined with slabs of marble belonging to the Domus Aurea. In the fourth century a domus was built on top of the complex, likely from a building used to service the tank itself. In the Middle Ages, the northernmost chambers were used as catacombs and more than a thousand skeletons were discovered here during the 1967 excavations.\n",
      "Located at the edge of the park, the cistern is well preserved (entrance on the Via delle Terme di Traiano).\n",

The room is in the residential wing of the palace, added by Pope Sixtus V. It was decorated by Pope Clement VIII.

Commissioned by Pope Clement VII, the theme of the tapestries is the life of Christ. The tapestries remained unfinished on Raphael's death, and along with tapestries for the Sala del Consistorio were woven in Brussels. The carved and gilded ceiling contains frescos by Cerubino Alberti and Paul Bril.In February 2013, at a ceremony in Sala del Concistoro to announce the date for the canonisation of three martyrs, Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation.\n",

      "it rose close to the corner of the present Viale dei Bastioni di Michelangelo, Piazza Risorgimento and Via di Porta Angelica, where a coat of arms of Pope Pius XI is now visible.\n",
      "The gate, built before 1563 by Pope Pius IV with an elegant and simple bossage, was the main access route for the pilgrims arriving to Rome through Via Cassia or via Flaminia.\n",
      "The name Angelica (Italian for \"Angelic\") originates from the Christian name of the Pope who built it, Giovanni Angelo Medici, who wanted to convey the memory of his own works, not just through the inscriptions, but also in the denominations of the monuments he realized (also Porta Pia is dedicated to him).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some remains of the gate are still visible enchased in the wall along Viale dei Bastioni di Michelangelo: they are a linear inscription \"ANGELIS SVIS MANDAVIT DE TE VT CVSTODIANT TE IN OMNIBVS VIIS TVIS\" (\"He sent his angels to you so that they watch over you along all your ways\"), the coat of arms of Pius IV (from which the balls have been removed) and two statues of cross-bearing angels, formerly placed on the sides of the gate. According to some testimonies, the gate also bore the following writing, alike the one on Porta Castello: \"QUI VULT SALVAM REMP. NOS SEQUATUR\" (\"Who wants the Republic to be save, follow us\"), an incitement coming from the two angels on the sides of both gates.\n",
      "According to a custom in force at least since the 5th century, the gate was farmed out to private citizens, together with the annexed guard-house. In 1673 the management of the gate (including the collection of the toll as well) was entrusted to the noble Roman family Carpegna and, in 1750, to Lambertini. Since both families were relatives of the ruling pontiffs, probably the city traffic through that passage was rather intense, so as to ensure an adequate income.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of the 18th century, some iron cages were added to the attic of the gate: their purpose was to contain the heads of executed men, according to a centuries-old practice to publicly exhibit the condemned people. The first head, that was caged in Porta Angelica on July 4, 1703, belonged to a certain Mattia Troiani, a servant of a Monsignor of the Curia who was killed by him.\n",
      "Here took place, on April 30, 1849, the first attack against the Roman Republic launched by the French troops led by General Charles Oudinot and fought against by the defenders on the orders of Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n",
      "The gate was demolished in 1888, together with the whole stretch of wall that linked it to Castel Sant'Angelo, as part of the urban works intended to make the Rione Borgo more modern and usable.\n",
